 **[ Not Working In FF (Bugzilla); Best In Chrome && OK in IE11 ]**  <br>Send the balls off their path by drawing planks through their trail. <br>**FYI:** For now, don't draw a perfectly horizontal plank (make sure it at least has a slight angle).  There's a glitch that causes the balls to disappear that I have to try to fix.  Thanks to @KK4OXJ for bringing it to my attention ;)
